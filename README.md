## TrekYourWorld Data
TrekYourWorld is an open source project made for the trekking/hiking community. The goal of the project is to bring all organisations under one roof so that people can decide which trek they want to choose.

This repository is the data aggregator for the TrekYourWorld project. All the treks information is contained under one roof and ingested into the database.
